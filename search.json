Next steps will be to write a script to process the file. Some tasks: a. create an image that shows the entire game b. load the moves and commentary into a model that can be persisted in a database.\nI did a bit of research into loading the file from a storage location into a jupyter notebook but I haven’t completed this task - I don’t think it’s the best way, but it might be a useful pre-analyis task to know how to do."
